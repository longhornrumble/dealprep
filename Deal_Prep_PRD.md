# AI Deal Prep System – Level 2

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 1. Overview

### Product Name

AI-Powered Deal Prep System – Level 2

### Owner

Chris (MyRecruiter)

### Problem Statement

Inbound and outbound sales conversations require significant manual research to be effective. This research is time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to scale for a solopreneur. As a result, many sales calls start with basic discovery instead of immediately demonstrating value.

### Solution Summary

Build an automated system that prepares a **Level 2 Deal Prep Brief** for every sales conversation by researching the prospect’s organization and contact, analyzing their website and messaging, and synthesizing insights into a structured, actionable brief before the meeting.

### Guiding Principle

> Show up to every call as the most prepared person in the room — automatically.

---

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

* Eliminate manual pre-call research
* Increase sales call effectiveness and confidence
* Personalize demos and conversations by org and role
* Reduce sales cycle length
* Centralize prospect context inside the CRM

### Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)

* Predictive ROI modeling
* Lead scoring or qualification automation
* Multi-rep sales enablement
* Customer-facing outputs
* Analytics dashboards
* CRM replacement

---

## 3. Users & Use Cases

### Primary User

* Chris (solopreneur, founder-led sales)

### Core Use Cases

1. Inbound prospect submits demo request
2. Chris runs deal prep manually for outbound prospect
3. Chris reviews prep brief before meeting
4. Chris references brief during call
5. Chris uses follow-up email generated by system

---

## 4. Trigger Model

### Supported Triggers

#### Inbound Trigger

* Source: Website form submission or meeting booking
* Actor: Unknown visitor
* Data collected automatically

#### Outbound Trigger

* Source: Internal submission by Chris
* Actor: Chris
* Allows partial or manually gathered data

### Trigger Rules

* Both triggers invoke the same orchestration pipeline
* Missing fields are permitted and handled gracefully
* Trigger source is recorded in metadata

---

## 5. System Architecture
